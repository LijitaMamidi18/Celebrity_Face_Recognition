# Celebrity_Face_Recognition
This is a machine learning project focused on classifying sports personalities into one of five well-known athletes using structured data or image inputs. The project demonstrates how ML models can be applied for classification tasks in a simplified sports-related context.
**Objective**
To build and deploy a machine learning model that can classify a given input as one of the following sports personalities:
1. Maria Sharapova
2. Serena Williams
3. Virat Kohli
4. Roger Federer
5. Lionel Messi 

**Technologies & Tools Used**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for web interface)

**ML Workflow**
1. Data Collection – Gather data related to each player (could be images or features like name, sport, stats, etc.)
2. Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the dataset
3. Model Selection – Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, or CNN for image classification)
4. Training – Train the model on labeled data
5. Evaluation – Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall to evaluate performance
6. Deployment – Deploy using Streamlit for user interaction
